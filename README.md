# Pokemon RBY RouteOne Python Fork

This is a Python rewrite of [RouteOne](https://github.com/pokemon-speedrunning/routeone), a powerful routing tool used for speedruns of Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow.

A lot of the core logic is taken directly from the source repository, but some additional features have been added as well.

## Usage

To start using this project, all you need is the pre-compiled executable (found in releases) and a route .yaml file. Click and drag any properly formatted .yaml route file and an output file should appear.

I would recommend looking at one of the example files found in [example_routes/](example_routes/) to start as a template.

### Route File

See [route_file_help.md](route_file_help.md) for more information about how to start writing a route file.
